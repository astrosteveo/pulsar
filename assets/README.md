## Recording a quick demo GIF

1. Use a terminal recorder (e.g., asciinema + agg or peek) to capture a small session that:
   - Creates a temporary ZSH config dir
   - Downloads pulsar.zsh
   - Defines PULSAR_* arrays
   - Sources pulsar.zsh
   - Shows a plugin working (e.g., romkatv/zsh-bench present on PATH)
2. Keep it short (<15s) and minimal in resolution for a small footprint.
3. Save as `assets/pulsar-demo.gif` and commit.

Optional command sketch (macOS):

```bash
# Install: brew install --cask kap
# Or: brew install --cask peek (Linux alternatives: peek, silentcast)
```
