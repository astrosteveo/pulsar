# Tasks: Minimal Zsh Plugin Manager (Pulsar)

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-are-creating`

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-we-are-creating/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, quickstart.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Integration tests are included as part of this implementation per Constitution requirement (80% critical path coverage).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Branch Workflow (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**BEFORE STARTING ANY TASKS:**

1. Ensure you are on an up-to-date `main` branch: `git checkout main && git pull`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b 001-we-are-creating`
3. **ALL work MUST happen in this feature branch - NEVER commit directly to `main`**

**DURING IMPLEMENTATION:**

- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages following conventional commit format
- Push to remote regularly: `git push origin 001-we-are-creating`
- Run all tests before each push to ensure nothing is broken

**AFTER COMPLETING ALL TASKS:**

1. Ensure all tests pass: run full test suite
2. Push final changes: `git push origin 001-we-are-creating`
3. Open Pull Request (PR) from `001-we-are-creating` to `main`
4. PR description MUST link to this tasks.md and the spec.md
5. Address review feedback by pushing additional commits to the same branch
6. Once approved and CI passes, merge to `main`
7. Delete feature branch after successful merge

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

All paths are relative to repository root: `/home/astrosteveo/workspace/pulsar/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Initialize project structure and development tools

- [ ] T001 [P] Create `.editorconfig` for consistent code formatting
- [ ] T002 [P] Create `.shellcheckrc` with Zsh-specific linting rules
- [ ] T003 [P] Create `Makefile` with targets: test, lint, install-dev, clean
- [ ] T004 [P] Update `README.md` with Quick Start, installation instructions, and feature overview
- [ ] T005 [P] Create example configuration files:
  - `examples/pulsar_declarative.zsh` - Simple declarative array-based setup
  - `examples/pulsar_example.zsh` - Full-featured manual control examples
  - `examples/omz_migration.zsh` - OMZ to Pulsar migration example

**Checkpoint**: Development environment and documentation structure ready

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Core Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Core plugin manager functions that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

### Core Functions

- [ ] T006 [Foundational] Implement plugin spec parser in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Parse GitHub shorthand (`user/repo`)
  - Parse OMZ subdirectory paths (`ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/plugins/git`)
  - Parse version pins (`user/repo@v1.2.3`)
  - Parse local paths (`/path/to/plugin`)
  - Extract repo, subdir, version, type attributes

- [ ] T007 [Foundational] Implement XDG cache path resolver in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Respect `XDG_CACHE_HOME` if set
  - Default to `$HOME/.cache/pulsar`
  - Create cache directory if missing
  - Generate plugin directory names (e.g., `owner--repo`)

- [ ] T008 [Foundational] Implement init file discovery in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Search order: `{name}.plugin.zsh`, `{name}.zsh`, `init.zsh`, `*.plugin.zsh(N[1])`, `*.zsh(N[1])`
  - Handle subdirectory plugins (OMZ-style)
  - Return absolute path to discovered init file or error

- [ ] T009 [Foundational] Implement warning/error message system in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - `_pulsar_warn()` - Formatted warnings with plugin name
  - `_pulsar_debug()` - Debug messages when `PULSAR_DEBUG=1`
  - Color support with auto-detection
  - Respect `PULSAR_QUIET=1` to suppress warnings

- [ ] T010 [Foundational] Implement configuration variable defaults in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - `PULSAR_HOME`, `PULSAR_GITURL`, `PULSAR_PROGRESS`, `PULSAR_COLOR`
  - `PULSAR_BANNER`, `PULSAR_UPDATE_CHANNEL`, `PULSAR_MAX_JOBS`
  - `PULSAR_DEBUG`, `PULSAR_QUIET`
  - Auto-detect reasonable defaults (e.g., `nproc` for max jobs)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all core utilities available for user story implementation

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic Plugin Management (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can clone, load, and manage Zsh plugins from GitHub with minimal configuration

**Independent Test**: Install Pulsar, declare 2-3 plugins in `.zshrc`, verify they clone in parallel and load on shell startup

### US1 Core Implementation

- [ ] T011 [US1] Implement `plugin-clone` function in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Clone single plugin from GitHub using `git clone`
  - Support version pinning (checkout tag/branch/commit after clone)
  - Support local paths (skip cloning, validate path exists)
  - Error handling with informative warnings
  - Create cache directory if missing
  - Return 0 on success, 1 on failure

- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement parallel cloning in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - `_pulsar_parallel_clone()` - Clone multiple plugins concurrently

  - Bounded parallelism (respect `PULSAR_MAX_JOBS`)
  - Track failures per plugin
  - Progress indicators during cloning

- [ ] T013 [US1] Implement `plugin-load` function in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Accept plugin array (`PULSAR_PLUGINS`, `PULSAR_PATH`, `PULSAR_FPATH`)
  - Clone missing plugins (call parallel clone)
  - Discover init file for each plugin
  - Source init file (for `PULSAR_PLUGINS`)
  - Track loaded plugins to avoid duplicates
  - Graceful failure handling (warn and continue)

- [ ] T014 [US1] Create installer script `install.sh`:
  - Detect ZDOTDIR or use `~/.zshrc`
  - Create timestamped backup (`.zshrc.backup.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`)
  - Verify backup succeeded before proceeding
  - Check if Pulsar block already exists (skip if present)
  - Append Pulsar configuration block with example plugins
  - Report backup location and next steps to user
  - Handle errors gracefully (restore backup if needed)

- [ ] T014a [US1] Add VS Code ZDOTDIR shim to installer in `install.sh`:
  - Detect if ZDOTDIR is set
  - Create `.zshenv` shim at `~/.zshenv` if needed (enables VS Code terminal)
  - Shim sources `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv` to propagate environment
  - Skip if shim already exists or ZDOTDIR not set
  - Document shim purpose in installer output

### US1 Integration Tests

- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Create integration tests in `tests/test-pulsar.md`:

  - Test: ZDOTDIR respected if set
  - Test: Installer fails safely if backup fails

**Checkpoint**: MVP complete - users can install Pulsar and load plugins automatically

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Flexible Plugin Loading (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Support different loading modes (source, PATH, fpath) and oh-my-zsh plugins without OMZ

**Independent Test**: Configure one plugin of each type (PULSAR_PLUGINS, PULSAR_PATH, PULSAR_FPATH), verify each behaves correctly. Test OMZ plugin loading.

### US2 Core Implementation

- [ ] T017 [US2] Implement PATH mode loading in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Detect `bin/` directory in plugin cache
  - Add to `$PATH` without sourcing

  - No sourcing, just fpath modification
  - Handle completions and prompts

- [ ] T019 [US2] Enhance `plugin-load` to support `--kind` flag in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - `plugin-load --kind source user/repo` - Source init file
  - `plugin-load --kind path user/repo` - Add to PATH only
  - `plugin-load --kind fpath user/repo` - Add to fpath only
  - Default to `source` if no flag provided
  - Update internal tracking for each mode

- [ ] T020 [US2] Enhance OMZ subdirectory support in `pulsar.zsh`:

  - Load from subdirectory (e.g., `plugins/git`)
  - Share single clone across multiple OMZ plugins
  - Init file discovery within subdirectories
  - Handle OMZ naming conventions (`.plugin.zsh` suffix)

### US2 Integration Tests

  - Test: Load git plugin via `ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/plugins/git`
  - Test: Load docker plugin via `ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/plugins/docker`
  - Test: Multiple OMZ plugins share single clone
  - Test: Init file discovery in OMZ subdirectories
  - Test: OMZ plugin functions become available after load

- [ ] T022 [P] [US2] Add loading mode tests to `tests/test-pulsar.md`:
  - Test: PULSAR_PATH adds tool to PATH without sourcing
  - Test: PULSAR_FPATH adds completions to fpath
  - Test: Mixed loading modes work together
  - Test: `--kind` flag works for manual loading

**Checkpoint**: All loading modes working, OMZ compatibility validated

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Plugin Updates and Compilation (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Update all plugins and compile init files for performance

**Independent Test**: Install plugins, run `plugin-update`, verify git pulls succeed. Run `plugin-compile`, verify `.zwc` files created.

### US3 Core Implementation

  - Handle errors gracefully (warn and continue)
  - Summary: X updated, Y pinned (skipped), Z failed
  - Return success if at least one plugin updated

- [ ] T024 [US3] Implement `plugin-compile` function in `pulsar.zsh`:

  - Run `zcompile` on each to create `.zwc` bytecode
  - Skip if `.zwc` already exists and is newer than source
  - Display compilation progress
  - Handle errors gracefully (warn and continue)

- [ ] T025 [US3] Enhance `plugin-load` to prefer compiled files in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Check if `.zwc` exists and is newer than source
  - Load `.zwc` if available, otherwise load source
  - Transparent to user (automatic optimization)

### US3 Integration Tests

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Add update/compile tests to `tests/test-pulsar.md`:

  - Test: Warning displayed when init file not found
  - Test: Remaining plugins load after one failure
  - Test: Error messages are user-friendly (not raw git output)
  - Test: Warning when git command not found (simulate missing git)
  - Test: Graceful handling when cache directory deleted mid-session
  - Test: Warning for plugin with syntax errors in init file
  - Test: Timeout handling for slow network (simulate rate limiting)
  - Test: Cache cleanup for plugins removed from arrays

**Checkpoint**: Update and compilation working, error handling validated

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Manual Plugin Control (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Power users can manually control plugins via direct function calls

**Independent Test**: Call functions directly: `plugin-clone user/repo`, `plugin-load user/repo`, verify behavior without declarative arrays

### US4 Core Implementation

- [ ] T028 [US4] Implement standalone `plugin-clone` usage in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Accept plugin spec as argument
  - Work independently of arrays
  - Idempotent (skip if already cloned)
  - Support version pinning via `@` syntax

- [ ] T028a [US4] Add `--force` flag to `plugin-clone` in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Accept `--force` flag before plugin spec argument
  - Remove existing cache directory for plugin if present
  - Re-clone from scratch (useful for corrupted cache)
  - Usage: `plugin-clone --force user/repo`
  - Document in help text and README

- [ ] T029 [US4] Implement `plugin-load-manual` function in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Load single plugin by spec (not from array)
  - Clone if missing (call `plugin-clone`)
  - Discover and source init file
  - Track loaded state to avoid duplicates
  - Work alongside declarative loading

- [ ] T030 [US4] Implement `pulsar-check-conflicts` diagnostic command in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Track command sources during plugin loading

  - Detect when multiple plugins provide same command
  - Display conflicts with source plugins
  - Show which plugin "won" (loaded last)

- [ ] T031 [US4] Implement conflict detection during load in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Before/after snapshot of `${(k)commands}` array
  - Detect new commands added by plugin
  - Warn if command already exists from different plugin
  - Continue loading (non-blocking)

### US4 Integration Tests

- [ ] T032 [P] [US4] Add manual control tests to `tests/test-pulsar.md`:
  - Test: `plugin-clone` works standalone
  - Test: `plugin-load-manual` loads single plugin
  - Test: Manual and declarative loading coexist
  - Test: Idempotent cloning (skip if exists)

- [ ] T033 [P] [US4] Create conflict detection tests in `tests/test-conflicts.md`:
  - Test: Conflict warning when two plugins provide same command
  - Test: `pulsar-check-conflicts` lists all conflicts
  - Test: Last plugin wins (Zsh default behavior)
  - Test: Conflict detection doesn't block loading

**Checkpoint**: Manual control and diagnostics working

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Self-Update and Version Management (Priority: P5)

**Goal**: Keep Pulsar itself updated with notifications

**Independent Test**: Run `pulsar-self-update`, verify it fetches latest code. Check that notifications appear after configured intervals.

### US5 Core Implementation

- [ ] T034 [US5] Implement update channel state management in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Read/write `$PULSAR_HOME/.pulsar-state`
  - Store: `last_update_check`, `update_channel`, `last_self_update`
  - Calculate `next_update_check` based on channel
  - Respect `PULSAR_UPDATE_CHANNEL` variable

- [ ] T035 [US5] Implement update check on shell startup in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Check if enough time passed since last check
  - Skip if `PULSAR_UPDATE_CHANNEL=off`
  - For `stable`: Check every 24h, prompt user
  - For `unstable`: Check every 6h, auto-update
  - Non-blocking (don't delay shell startup)

- [ ] T036 [US5] Implement `pulsar-self-update` function in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Fetch latest `pulsar.zsh` from GitHub
  - Require `curl` (warn if missing)
  - Backup current version before update
  - Replace with new version
  - Source new version to apply immediately
  - Display version change message

- [ ] T037 [US5] Implement `pulsar-update` combined function in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Call `pulsar-self-update` first
  - Then call `plugin-update` for all plugins
  - Single command updates everything
  - Display combined summary

### US5 Integration Tests

- [ ] T038 [P] [US5] Create update tests in `tests/test-updater.md`:
  - Test: Update check respects channel setting
  - Test: `PULSAR_UPDATE_CHANNEL=off` skips checks
  - Test: `pulsar-self-update` fetches latest code
  - Test: `pulsar-update` updates both Pulsar and plugins
  - Test: Update check doesn't block shell startup
  - Test: Graceful fallback if `curl` missing

**Checkpoint**: Self-update and versioning complete

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Basic Management) - No user story dependencies, can start after Foundational
  - US2 (Flexible Loading) - Extends US1 but can be tested independently
  - US3 (Updates/Compilation) - Uses US1 functions but can be tested independently
  - US4 (Manual Control) - Uses US1 functions but can be tested independently
  - US5 (Self-Update) - Independent, can start after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Independence

Each user story can be delivered as an independent increment:

- **MVP (US1 only)**: Basic plugin management - users can install and load plugins
- **MVP + US2**: Add loading modes and OMZ compatibility - major value add
- **MVP + US2 + US3**: Add updates and compilation - complete user workflow
- **All stories**: Full-featured plugin manager

### Within Each User Story

- Tests run in parallel (marked [P])
- Core implementation tasks may have dependencies
- Integration tests after implementation
- Story complete and testable before moving to next

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:

- All T001-T005 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:

- T009 (messaging) and T010 (config) can run parallel to T006-T008
- T006-T008 are sequential (parser ‚Üí cache ‚Üí discovery)

**Phase 3 (US1)**:

- T015-T016 tests can run in parallel
- T011-T012 can run in parallel (different functions)
- T013 depends on T011-T012

**Phase 4 (US2)**:

- T017-T018 can run in parallel (different modes)
- T021-T022 tests can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**:

- T023-T024 can run in parallel (update vs compile)
- T026-T027 tests can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (US4)**:

- T028-T029 can run in parallel (clone vs load)
- T032-T033 tests can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (US5)**:

- T034-T037 are mostly sequential (state ‚Üí check ‚Üí update)
- T038 tests can run after implementation

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:

- T039, T041, T043 can run in parallel
- T040, T042, T044 may need sequential execution

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Tests for US1 (run in parallel):
Task T015: "Create integration tests in tests/test-pulsar.md"
Task T016: "Create installer tests in tests/test-installer.md"

# Core functions (run in parallel):
Task T011: "Implement plugin-clone function in pulsar.zsh"
Task T012: "Implement parallel cloning in pulsar.zsh"
# Then after both complete:
Task T013: "Implement plugin-load function in pulsar.zsh (depends on T011-T012)"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Recommended)

1. **Phase 1**: Setup ‚Üí Initialize project structure
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational ‚Üí Core utilities ready
3. **Phase 3**: User Story 1 ‚Üí Basic plugin management (MVP!)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test MVP independently
5. Deploy/demo to early users for feedback

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2) ‚Üí Core ready
2. **MVP** (Phase 3, US1) ‚Üí Install and load plugins ‚úÖ
3. **Enhanced** (Phase 4, US2) ‚Üí Add loading modes and OMZ ‚úÖ
4. **Complete** (Phase 5, US3) ‚Üí Add updates and compilation ‚úÖ
5. **Power User** (Phase 6, US4) ‚Üí Add manual control ‚úÖ
6. **Self-Maintaining** (Phase 7, US5) ‚Üí Add self-update ‚úÖ
7. **Polished** (Phase 8) ‚Üí Optimize and document ‚úÖ

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2-3 developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (MVP - highest priority)
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Loading modes)
- **Developer C**: User Story 5 (Self-update - independent)

Then converge for US3, US4, and Polish.
