## Work Completed

### 1. CRITICAL Fixes (3 items) ✅

#### CHK106 - Progress Indicators vs Overhead Conflict

**Problem**: Unclear if progress indicators conflict with <50ms overhead target.

**Solution**: Added clarification to `spec.md`:
> Q: Do progress indicators conflict with the <50ms overhead target? → A: No - Progress indicators only appear for long-running operations (>1 second duration) like initial cloning or updates. The <50ms overhead target applies to manager initialization and cached plugin loading, which happen without progress display.

**Impact**: Removes performance vs UX ambiguity, enables confident implementation.

---

#### CHK108 - Version Pin Update Behavior

**Problem**: Unclear what happens when `plugin-update` encounters pinned plugin.

**Solution**: Added clarification to `spec.md`:
> Q: What happens when `plugin-update` encounters a version-pinned plugin? → A: Skip silently during batch update, report in summary as "N pinned (not updated)". Users can manually update pins by changing the version specifier in their plugin declaration.

**Impact**: Defines clear, predictable behavior for version-pinned plugins.

---

#### CHK112 - Plugin Loading Order

**Problem**: Loading order within arrays not deterministic.

**Solution**: Added clarification to `spec.md`:
> Q: In what order are plugins loaded within each array? → A: Plugins load in array declaration order (top to bottom as declared in .zshrc). This ensures deterministic, predictable loading sequence for dependency management.

**Impact**: Enables users to control load order for plugin dependencies.

---

### 2. HIGH Priority Fixes (3 items) ✅

#### CHK056 - Error Propagation Requirements

**Problem**: No requirements for function return codes and error propagation.

**Solution**: Added **FR-021** to `spec.md`:
> FR-021: All shell functions MUST return 0 on success, non-zero on failure, and propagate errors correctly to enable proper error handling in calling contexts

**Impact**: Establishes clear contract for error handling throughout codebase.

**Task Coverage**: Cross-cutting requirement validated during code review and testing.

---

#### CHK055-CHK064 - Shell Safety Requirements (10 items)

**Problem**: No comprehensive shell safety requirements (quoting, arrays, error handling).

**Solution**: Added **Shell Safety Requirements** section to `plan.md` with 10 requirements:

1. **Quoting**: All variable expansions MUST be quoted (`"$var"`, `"${array[@]}"`)
2. **Error Propagation**: Functions MUST return 0 on success, non-zero on failure
3. **Array Handling**: Array expansions MUST use `"${array[@]}"` syntax
4. **Subshell Isolation**: Parallel operations MUST use proper job control
5. **Glob Pattern Safety**: Use `setopt nullglob` for safe iteration
6. **PATH Safety**: Check for duplicates to prevent PATH pollution
7. **Special Characters**: Handle special characters via quoting/escaping
8. **Infinite Recursion Prevention**: Track loaded plugins
9. **Directory Safety**: Validate and create directories with error checking
10. **Git Operation Safety**: Validate git availability, handle missing git gracefully

**Impact**: Establishes comprehensive safety standards for shell scripting, prevents common bugs.

**Task Coverage**: Cross-cutting requirements applied to all implementation tasks.

---

#### CHK067 - Disk Space Requirements

**Problem**: No documentation of cache size or cleanup policy.

**Solution**: Added **ASM-011** to `spec.md`:
> ASM-011: Typical plugin cache size is ~100MB for 20 plugins; no automatic cache cleanup is performed (users can manually delete cache directory if needed)

**Impact**: Sets user expectations for disk space usage, documents no-cleanup policy.

---

### 3. MEDIUM Priority Fixes (3 items) ✅

#### CHK040 - Recovery Flows

**Problem**: No documented recovery mechanisms for common failures.

**Solution**: Added **Recovery Flows** section to `spec.md` with 6 mechanisms:

1. **Cache corruption/deletion**: Re-clone automatically on next startup
2. **Failed plugin clone**: Use `plugin-clone <spec>` or `--force` to retry
3. **Installation errors**: Restore from `.zshrc.backup.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
4. **Plugin syntax errors**: Remove from arrays, restart shell
5. **Git failures during update**: Review warnings, retry specific plugins
6. **Broken dependencies**: Use `pulsar-check-conflicts` to identify issues

**Impact**: Provides clear recovery paths for users, reduces support burden.

---

#### CHK017 - Progress Indicator Format

**Problem**: Progress indicator format not specified.

**Solution**: Updated **FR-011** in `spec.md`:
> FR-011: System MUST provide progress indicators for long-running operations (cloning, updating) using format `[n/total] plugin-name` updated per completion

**Impact**: Defines consistent, predictable progress display format.

**Task Coverage**: Covered by T012 (clone progress), T023 (update progress).

---

#### CHK077 - Help Text Requirements

**Problem**: No requirements for help/usage messages.

**Solution**: Added **FR-022** to `spec.md`:
> FR-022: All user-facing manual functions MUST provide usage help via `--help` flag showing syntax, parameters, and examples

**Impact**: Ensures consistent, discoverable help for all commands.

**Task Coverage**: Covered by T040 (documentation, manual function reference).

---

### 4. Edge Case Documentation (10 items) ✅

**Problem**: 10 edge cases lacking formal requirements, unclear if blocking.

**Solution**: Created **KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md** documenting all 10 edge cases as LOW-risk deferrals to v2.0:

1. **Zero Plugins** - Edge case unlikely in practice
2. **Special Characters** - Standard GitHub naming avoids issues
3. **Network Timeouts** - Git defaults are reasonable
4. **Circular Symlinks** - Extremely rare in real repos
5. **Read-Only Filesystem** - Uncommon in interactive usage
6. **Non-Existent ZDOTDIR** - Zsh handles this at startup
7. **Git Version Compatibility** - Most systems have modern git
8. **Concurrent Git Operations** - Real-world collision rate negligible
9. **Large Repositories (>1GB)** - Not realistic for plugins
10. **Non-Standard Branch Names** - Git handles default branch correctly

**Risk Assessment**: Overall risk LOW - Most limitations affect rare edge cases unlikely in typical usage.

**Monitoring Plan**: Track user reports via GitHub issues, prioritize v2.0 fixes based on actual pain points.

**Impact**: Provides transparency about limitations, sets v2.0 priorities based on user feedback.

## Task Count Analysis

**Question**: Do FR-021 and FR-022 require new implementation tasks?

**Answer**: No new tasks needed.

**Rationale**:

- **FR-021 (Error Propagation)**: Cross-cutting code quality requirement applied to all function implementations. Validated during code review, testing (T027), and Constitution compliance check (plan.md specifies complexity limits, error handling patterns).

- **FR-022 (Help Text)**: Covered by existing **T040** (Update README.md with complete documentation). T040 already includes "Manual function reference" which will document syntax, parameters, and examples for all user-facing functions.

**Task Count**: Remains **46 tasks** across 8 phases (no change).
