# Implementation Quality Checklist: Pulsar Plugin Manager

**Purpose**: Validate requirement quality before implementation - "Unit Tests for Requirements Writing"

**Created**: 2025-10-07

**Scope**: Balanced coverage - All quality dimensions (Completeness, Clarity, Consistency, Coverage, Shell Safety, Performance, UX, Compatibility)

**Depth**: Lightweight pre-commit sanity check

**Risk Focus**: All critical areas (Shell Safety, Performance, User Experience, Compatibility)

**Note**: This checklist tests whether REQUIREMENTS are well-written, NOT whether implementation works correctly.

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Items**: 118
- **Requirements with traceability**: ~85% (100+ items reference spec sections or mark gaps)
- **Critical gaps identified**: 40+ missing requirement areas
- **Ambiguities requiring clarification**: 13 high-priority items (CHK106-CHK113)
- **Constitution compliance**: Validated ✓

## Recommended Next Steps

**Before Implementation:**

1. **Address Critical Ambiguities** (CHK106-CHK113) - These will cause confusion during coding
2. **Fill Safety Gaps** (CHK055-CHK064) - Shell safety requirements are underdefined
3. **Clarify Performance** (CHK065-CHK073) - Quantify vague performance terms
4. **Define Recovery Flows** (CHK040-CHK044) - Missing failure recovery requirements

**Priority Order:**

- 🔴 **High**: CHK106-CHK113 (ambiguities), CHK055-CHK064 (safety)
- 🟡 **Medium**: CHK040-CHK044 (recovery), CHK001-CHK010 (completeness)
- 🟢 **Low**: Edge cases, nice-to-have clarifications

**Quality Gate**: Recommend resolving at least CHK106-CHK113 before T006 (Foundational implementation).
