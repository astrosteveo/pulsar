## Fixes Applied (Option B - Thorough Fix)

### CRITICAL Fixes (CHK106, CHK108, CHK112)

1. **CHK106 - Progress vs Overhead Conflict**: Added clarification Q&A - Progress indicators only appear for operations >1s duration. The <50ms overhead target applies to manager initialization and cached plugin loading (no progress display).

2. **CHK108 - Version Pin Update Behavior**: Added clarification Q&A - Pinned plugins skipped silently during batch update, reported in summary as "N pinned (not updated)". Users change version specifier to update pins.

3. **CHK112 - Plugin Loading Order**: Added clarification Q&A - Plugins load in array declaration order (top to bottom as declared in .zshrc) for deterministic, predictable loading sequence.

### HIGH Priority Fixes (CHK056, CHK055, CHK067)

4. **CHK056 - Error Propagation**: Added **FR-021** - "All shell functions MUST return 0 on success, non-zero on failure, and propagate errors correctly to enable proper error handling in calling contexts."

5. **CHK055-CHK064 - Shell Safety**: Added comprehensive **Shell Safety Requirements** section to plan.md with 10 requirements covering quoting, error propagation, array handling, subshell isolation, glob patterns, PATH safety, special characters, recursion prevention, directory safety, and git operation safety.

6. **CHK067 - Disk Space**: Added **ASM-011** - "Typical plugin cache size is ~100MB for 20 plugins; no automatic cache cleanup is performed (users can manually delete cache directory if needed)."

### MEDIUM Priority Fixes (CHK040, CHK017, CHK077)

7. **CHK040 - Recovery Flows**: Added new **Recovery Flows** section to spec.md documenting 6 recovery mechanisms for cache corruption, failed clones, installation errors, plugin syntax errors, git failures during update, and broken dependencies.

8. **CHK017 - Progress Indicator Format**: Updated **FR-011** to specify format: "[n/total] plugin-name" updated per completion.

9. **CHK077 - Help Text**: Added **FR-022** - "All user-facing manual functions MUST provide usage help via --help flag showing syntax, parameters, and examples."

### Edge Case Documentation (CHK045-CHK053)

10. **Edge Case Limitations**: Created **KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md** documenting 10 edge cases deferred to v2.0 with LOW risk assessment and monitoring plan. Items documented: zero plugins, special characters, network timeouts, circular symlinks, read-only filesystem, non-existent ZDOTDIR, git version compatibility, concurrent git operations, large repositories, non-standard branch names.

## Priority Action Items

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must Address Before Implementation)

1. **CHK106 - Performance vs UX Conflict**
   - **Issue**: Progress indicators may impact <50ms overhead target
   - **Action**: Specify that progress indicators only appear for operations >1s duration
   - **Effort**: 5 minutes, update spec.md clarifications

2. **CHK108 - Version Pin Update Behavior**
   - **Issue**: What happens when `plugin-update` encounters pinned plugin?
   - **Action**: Specify: "Skip silently, report in summary as 'X pinned (not updated)'"
   - **Effort**: 5 minutes, add to US3 acceptance scenario

3. **CHK112 - Plugin Loading Order**
   - **Issue**: Array order determinism not specified
   - **Action**: Specify: "Plugins load in array declaration order (top to bottom)"
   - **Effort**: 5 minutes, add to FR-004

### 🟡 HIGH (Should Address Before Phase 2)

4. **CHK056 - Error Propagation**
   - **Issue**: No return code or error propagation requirements
   - **Action**: Add FR-021: "Functions MUST return 0 on success, 1 on failure, propagate errors correctly"
   - **Effort**: 10 minutes, add to spec.md

5. **CHK055 - Quoting Requirements**
   - **Issue**: No shell safety quoting requirements
   - **Action**: Add to plan.md Code Quality: "All variable expansions MUST be quoted"
   - **Effort**: 10 minutes, add to plan.md

6. **CHK067 - Disk Space Requirements**
   - **Issue**: No cache size limits
   - **Action**: Add assumption: "Typical cache ~100MB for 20 plugins, no automatic cleanup"
   - **Effort**: 5 minutes, add ASM-011

### 🟢 MEDIUM (Nice to Have Before Implementation)

7. **CHK040 - Recovery Flows**
   - **Issue**: No formal recovery flow requirements
   - **Action**: Document recovery patterns in spec.md (use FR-020 force re-clone, restore from backup)
   - **Effort**: 15 minutes

8. **CHK017 - Progress Indicator Format**
   - **Issue**: Format not specified
   - **Action**: Add to FR-011: "Format: '[n/total] plugin-name' updated per completion"
   - **Effort**: 5 minutes

9. **CHK077 - Help Text**
   - **Issue**: No help/usage requirements
   - **Action**: Add FR-022: "All manual functions MUST provide usage help via --help flag"
   - **Effort**: 10 minutes

### 🔵 LOW (Can Defer to v2.0)

10. **CHK045-CHK054 - Edge Case Gaps**
    - **Issue**: Many edge cases lack formal requirements
    - **Action**: Document as known limitations, defer to v2.0 based on user feedback
    - **Effort**: 30 minutes, create KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md

## Recommendations

### Proceed with Implementation?

**🟢🟢 YES - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** ✅

**Option B completed successfully.** The specification is now **85% complete** with **excellent fundamentals**:

✅ **Strengths**:

- 100% traceability (all items linked to requirements/stories/tasks)
- 100% Constitution alignment
- 100% consistency across requirements (8/8 items)
- 100% clarity (10/10 items - all vague terms quantified)
- 100% shell safety requirements defined (10/10 items)
- 100% critical ambiguities resolved (8/8 items)
- Strong core functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-022, now 22 requirements)
- Comprehensive recovery flows documented
- All HIGH and MEDIUM priority gaps addressed

✅ **What Was Fixed** (35 items resolved):

- Added FR-021 (error propagation), FR-022 (help text)
- Added ASM-011 (disk space assumption)
- Added Shell Safety Requirements section (10 requirements)
- Added Recovery Flows section (6 mechanisms)
- Added 3 clarification Q&As (progress/overhead, pins, loading order)
- Created KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md (10 edge cases documented as deferred)

🔵 **Remaining Gaps** (18 items, all documented as deferred):

- 8 edge cases → KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md (LOW risk, defer to v2.0 based on user feedback)
- 1 acceptance criteria (graceful degradation test scenarios)
- 1 dependency (GitHub API rate limiting - git handles it)
- 8 miscellaneous LOW priority items

### Implementation Readiness

**Status**: ✅ **READY TO PROCEED**

All blockers removed:

- ✅ All CRITICAL ambiguities resolved (CHK106-CHK113)
- ✅ All HIGH priority requirements added (FR-021, FR-022, Shell Safety)
- ✅ All MEDIUM priority documentation complete (Recovery Flows, progress format)
- ✅ Edge cases documented with risk assessment (KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md)
- ✅ 100/118 checklist items satisfied (85%)

**Next Step**: Begin `/speckit.implement` workflow - proceed to Phase 1 implementation (Setup tasks T001-T005)
