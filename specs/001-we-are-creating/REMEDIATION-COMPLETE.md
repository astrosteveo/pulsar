- ✅ **Clear quality standards** - LOC definition explicit
- ✅ **Clean documentation** - No duplicate headings

---

## Remediation Details

### HIGH Priority (All Fixed)

#### ✅ FIND-001: Ambiguous Performance Metrics

**Resolution**: Added clarification to `spec.md`

**What was added**:

```markdown
- Q: What does "plugin manager overhead" mean for performance measurement?
  → A: Manager initialization only (cache check, array processing, parallel spawn setup)
  - excludes actual plugin sourcing time. Measured as time delta between Pulsar entry
  point and first plugin source call. Target: <50ms for the manager infrastructure itself.
```

**Impact**: Test T015 and benchmark T039 now have clear metric definition.

---

#### ✅ FIND-002: Missing VS Code ZDOTDIR Shim Task

**Resolution**: Added task T014a to `tasks.md`

**What was added**:

```markdown
- [ ] T014a [US1] Add VS Code ZDOTDIR shim to installer in `install.sh`:
  - Detect if ZDOTDIR is set
  - Create `.zshenv` shim at `~/.zshenv` if needed (enables VS Code terminal)
  - Shim sources `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv` to propagate environment
  - Skip if shim already exists or ZDOTDIR not set
  - Document shim purpose in installer output
```

**Impact**: FR-019 now has full implementation coverage. MVP scope updated to 17 tasks.

---

#### ✅ FIND-003: Missing Force Re-Clone Task

**Resolution**: Added task T028a to `tasks.md`

**What was added**:

```markdown
- [ ] T028a [US4] Add `--force` flag to `plugin-clone` in `pulsar.zsh`:
  - Accept `--force` flag before plugin spec argument
  - Remove existing cache directory for plugin if present
  - Re-clone from scratch (useful for corrupted cache)
  - Usage: `plugin-clone --force user/repo`
  - Document in help text and README
```

**Impact**: FR-020 now has full implementation coverage. Phase 6 updated to 7 tasks.

---

### MEDIUM Priority (All Fixed)

#### ✅ FIND-004: Init File Discovery Precedence Ambiguity

**Resolution**: Updated FR-002 in `spec.md` with explicit precedence order

**What was changed**:

```markdown
FR-002: System MUST automatically discover init files using precedence order:
1) {name}.plugin.zsh
2) {name}.zsh
3) init.zsh
4) first *.plugin.zsh match (glob)
5) first *.zsh match (glob)
where {name} is the plugin directory name
```

**Impact**: Task T008 implementation now has unambiguous specification.

---

#### ✅ FIND-005: Terminology Drift - "Plugin Spec"

**Resolution**: Standardized terminology across all documents

**What was changed**:

1. Added "Plugin Spec" to Key Entities in `spec.md`:

```markdown
- **Plugin Spec**: A string identifying a plugin source (see Clarifications for
  format details). Used consistently throughout arrays and manual functions.
  Formats: user/repo (GitHub), user/repo@v1.0 (version pin),
  user/repo/subdir/path (OMZ subdirectory), /abs/path (local)
```

2. Added clarification to `spec.md`:

```markdown
- Q: What is a "plugin spec"? → A: A string identifying a plugin source.
  Formats: user/repo (GitHub), user/repo@v1.0 (version pin),
  user/repo/subdir/path (OMZ subdirectory), /abs/path (local).
  Used consistently in plugin arrays and manual functions.
```

**Impact**: Consistent terminology across spec, plan, and tasks documents.

---

#### ✅ FIND-006: Missing Edge Case Coverage in Tasks

**Resolution**: Enhanced T027 with 5 additional edge case tests

**What was added to T027**:

```markdown
- Test: Warning when git command not found (simulate missing git)
- Test: Graceful handling when cache directory deleted mid-session
- Test: Warning for plugin with syntax errors in init file
- Test: Timeout handling for slow network (simulate rate limiting)
- Test: Cache cleanup for plugins removed from arrays
```

**Impact**: 9 of 10 documented edge cases now have explicit test coverage.

---

### LOW Priority (All Fixed)

#### ✅ FIND-007: Inconsistent LOC Definition

**Resolution**: Updated Constraints in `plan.md` with explicit counting method

**What was changed**:

```markdown
Codebase < 1000 lines of code (counted by `cloc pulsar.zsh --exclude-blank
--exclude-comments` - KISS principle)
```

**Impact**: Task T042 validation now has clear counting standard.

---

#### ✅ FIND-008: Duplicate Heading Lint Warnings

**Resolution**: Renamed all duplicate headings in `tasks.md` to be unique

**What was changed**:

- "Core Implementation" → "US1 Core Implementation", "US2 Core Implementation", etc.
- "Integration Tests" → "US1 Integration Tests", "US2 Integration Tests", etc.

**Impact**: Clean markdown linting, improved navigation in documentation tools.
