# Specification Quality Checklist: Pulsar v0.7.0 - Silent & Clean

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Spec Quality**: ✅ EXCELLENT

All quality criteria met:

1. **Content Quality** - Specification is written for non-technical stakeholders focusing on user value and business outcomes. No framework/language details leaked.

2. **Requirement Completeness** - All 45 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No clarification markers needed - all design decisions were informed by our discussion about silent operation, unified configuration, and KISS philosophy.

3. **Success Criteria** - All 15 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - Performance metrics (50ms overhead, <2s startup)
   - Code metrics (30% reduction to 700-800 lines)
   - User experience metrics (95% never need verbose mode)
   - Migration metrics (5 minutes to migrate)

4. **Coverage** - Specification covers 5 user stories (3 P1, 1 P2, 1 P3) with comprehensive acceptance scenarios, 9 edge cases, and 5 key entities.

5. **Scope** - Clearly bounded breaking changes:
   - Remove: PULSAR_PATH/PULSAR_FPATH arrays, VS Code shim
   - Preserve: All core functionality (parallel ops, OMZ/Prezto, version pinning, self-update)
   - Add: Silent operation, PULSAR_VERBOSE flag

**Ready for `/speckit.plan`**: YES ✅

No clarifications needed. Design decisions already resolved:

- Silent by default (P1 requirement)
- Global PULSAR_VERBOSE flag (not per-plugin)
- Unified array with prefix syntax
- 30% code reduction target
- Migration warning for legacy arrays
