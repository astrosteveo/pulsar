# Feature Specification: Pulsar v0.7.0 - Silent & Clean

**Feature Branch**: `003-pulsar-v0-7`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Pulsar v0.7.0: Silent by default with PULSAR_VERBOSE opt-in flag. Remove legacy PULSAR_PATH/PULSAR_FPATH arrays (breaking change). Remove VS Code shim. Simplify codebase to ~700-800 LOC while keeping core features: parallel operations, OMZ/Prezto shortcuts, version pinning, self-update, three loading modes (source/path/fpath with prefix syntax). Default experience should be clean and silent - only show output during actual operations (cloning, updating, errors). Global verbosity flag for debugging. Modern, fast, KISS philosophy."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Silent Shell Startup (Priority: P1)

A user wants their shell to start instantly and silently when plugins are already cached. They should only see output when something actually happens (first-time clone, update, error).

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - clean, fast startup experience is the primary user-facing improvement in v0.7.0. This is what users will notice immediately.

**Independent Test**: User opens a new shell with 10 cached plugins and sees no output. Startup time is indistinguishable from v0.6.0 but with zero visual noise.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** plugins are already cached, **When** user starts a new shell, **Then** no output is displayed and plugins load silently
2. **Given** a plugin needs to be cloned for the first time, **When** user starts a shell, **Then** only cloning progress is shown with a concise message
3. **Given** all plugins are current, **When** user runs `plugin-update`, **Then** output shows "âœ“ All plugins up to date" and nothing else
4. **Given** plugins have updates available, **When** user runs `plugin-update`, **Then** output shows only which plugins updated with commit counts
5. **Given** an error occurs during plugin loading, **When** shell starts, **Then** error is displayed clearly while other plugins continue loading silently

---

### User Story 2 - Simplified Plugin Configuration (Priority: P1)

A user wants a single, clean array for all plugins using intuitive prefix syntax for loading modes. No separate arrays, no confusion about where to put what.

**Why this priority**: Breaking change that must work perfectly. Simplification is the core architectural improvement that enables future maintainability.

**Independent Test**: User migrates from v0.6.0 configuration with separate PULSAR_PATH/PULSAR_FPATH arrays to v0.7.0 unified PULSAR_PLUGINS array. All plugins work identically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has basic plugins, **When** they declare `PULSAR_PLUGINS=(user/repo1 user/repo2)`, **Then** both plugins source normally (default mode)
2. **Given** user needs PATH mode, **When** they declare `PULSAR_PLUGINS=(path:user/repo)`, **Then** repo's bin/ directory is added to PATH without sourcing
3. **Given** user needs fpath mode, **When** they declare `PULSAR_PLUGINS=(fpath:user/repo)`, **Then** repo directory is added to fpath for completions without sourcing
4. **Given** user mixes modes, **When** they declare `PULSAR_PLUGINS=(user/repo1 fpath:user/repo2 path:user/repo3)`, **Then** each plugin loads with its specified mode
5. **Given** user has v0.6.0 config with PULSAR_PATH/PULSAR_FPATH, **When** they upgrade, **Then** system shows clear deprecation warning with migration example

---

### User Story 3 - Minimal Zshrc Experience (Priority: P2)

A new user wants the simplest possible .zshrc configuration that "just works" with sensible defaults. Like Oh-My-Zsh's 4-line setup, but for Pulsar.

**Why this priority**: First impression matters. Lower barrier to entry means more adoption. Users can start minimal and add complexity later.

**Independent Test**: User runs installer, chooses minimal setup, and ends up with a 5-10 line .zshrc that provides excellent defaults: completions, key bindings, and a clean prompt.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** fresh Zsh install, **When** user runs install.sh, **Then** installer asks "Install with sensible defaults? (completions, keybinds, prompt) [Y/n]"
2. **Given** user chooses default setup, **When** installer completes, **Then** .zshrc contains minimal config (~5-10 lines) that sources Pulsar and optional defaults
3. **Given** minimal setup chosen, **When** new shell starts, **Then** user has working completions, useful key bindings (Ctrl+R, arrow keys), and a clean prompt
4. **Given** user chooses custom setup, **When** installer completes, **Then** .zshrc contains only Pulsar source line (bare minimum for advanced users)
5. **Given** minimal setup, **When** user wants to customize, **Then** clear comments in .zshrc explain what each default does and how to disable

---

### User Story 4 - Debug Mode for Troubleshooting (Priority: P2)

A user encounters an issue and needs to see what Pulsar is doing. They set a global verbose flag and get detailed output for debugging.

**Why this priority**: Essential for maintainability and user support. Users need a way to troubleshoot without diving into code.

**Independent Test**: User sets `PULSAR_VERBOSE=1` in their config, restarts shell, and sees detailed output showing what Pulsar is doing for each plugin.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `PULSAR_VERBOSE=1` is set, **When** user starts shell, **Then** output shows each plugin being processed with timing information
2. **Given** verbose mode is off (default), **When** user starts shell with cached plugins, **Then** absolutely no output appears
3. **Given** `PULSAR_VERBOSE=1`, **When** plugin is cloned, **Then** output shows git clone command and progress details
4. **Given** `PULSAR_VERBOSE=1`, **When** entry point is discovered, **Then** output shows which files were checked and which was selected
5. **Given** user unsets PULSAR_VERBOSE, **When** shell starts, **Then** system returns to silent mode immediately

---

### User Story 5 - Streamlined Codebase (Priority: P3)

A developer wants to understand and maintain Pulsar's codebase easily. The code should be clean, well-documented, and under 800 lines without sacrificing core functionality.

**Why this priority**: Long-term maintainability and contribution-friendliness. Simpler code means fewer bugs and easier improvements.

**Independent Test**: Developer reads through pulsar.zsh and understands the flow within 30 minutes. Line count is verifiably under 800 lines.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** v0.6.0 codebase (~1089 lines), **When** v0.7.0 is complete, **Then** pulsar.zsh is 700-800 lines while retaining all core features
2. **Given** legacy PULSAR_PATH/PULSAR_FPATH code, **When** removed, **Then** prefix parsing in unified array handles all modes cleanly
3. **Given** VS Code shim code, **When** removed, **Then** codebase is simpler without affecting core plugin management
4. **Given** compilation complexity, **When** simplified or removed, **Then** codebase is cleaner without performance regression
5. **Given** entry point discovery (5 steps), **When** optimized, **Then** discovery still works for 95%+ of plugins with fewer code paths

---

### User Story 6 - Preserved Core Features (Priority: P1)

A user upgrades from v0.6.0 to v0.7.0 and expects all essential functionality to work identically: parallel cloning, OMZ/Prezto shortcuts, version pinning, self-update, and fast performance.

**Why this priority**: Critical for user retention. Breaking changes are acceptable, but feature regression is not. This defines what MUST work.

**Independent Test**: User runs v0.6.0 test suite against v0.7.0 codebase. All core feature tests pass (excluding tests for removed features).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has 10 plugins, **When** first-time cloning, **Then** all plugins clone in parallel completing in under 10 seconds
2. **Given** user uses `OMZP::git`, **When** loading plugins, **Then** Oh-My-Zsh git plugin loads correctly with shorthand expansion
3. **Given** user pins a plugin with `user/repo@v1.0`, **When** updating, **Then** plugin stays at v1.0 tag and doesn't update
4. **Given** new Pulsar version available, **When** user runs `pulsar-self-update`, **Then** Pulsar updates to latest stable release
5. **Given** 20 plugins configured, **When** shell starts, **Then** Pulsar overhead remains under 50ms (excluding plugin sourcing time)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user has both new unified array and old separate arrays in config?
- How does system handle invalid prefix syntax (e.g., `invalidmode:user/repo`)?
- What happens when user sets `PULSAR_VERBOSE` to non-boolean values (e.g., `PULSAR_VERBOSE=yes`)?
- How does deprecation warning display if user has no TTY (non-interactive shell)?
- What happens when a plugin has both source and path needs (e.g., needs bin/ in PATH AND needs sourcing)?
- How does system behave when user upgrades from v0.6.0 with edge channel configured?
- What happens when `PULSAR_VERBOSE` is changed mid-session (e.g., exported in current shell)?
- How does system handle when user has manually compiled .zwc files that reference removed code?
- What happens if user has custom wrapper functions around old PULSAR_PATH/PULSAR_FPATH?
- How does installer handle when .zshrc already exists but doesn't source Pulsar?
- How does example configs prompt handle non-interactive installation (e.g., CI/CD, scripted installs)?
- What happens when user wants to upgrade from v0.6.0 but already has custom history/completion/prompt config?
- What happens if user uncomments prompt example but their terminal doesn't support color codes?
